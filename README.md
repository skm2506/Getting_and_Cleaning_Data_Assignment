# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Assignment_Final_Submission

Final Peer Graded assignment submission for Getting and Cleaning Data Course from Data Science Specialization.


As per assignment guide lines I have created the R. script, which does the following task.


Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
Load the activity and feature info
Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
Merges the two datasets
Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
